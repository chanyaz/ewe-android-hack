    This file contains colors that are defined in main for compilation purposes, but that are only actually
    displayed in comet brands. These colors here are just dummy colors. Please ignore.

    When we refactor the home screen to allow us to pull brand-specific code out of main, then we should be
    able to clean up this file.
