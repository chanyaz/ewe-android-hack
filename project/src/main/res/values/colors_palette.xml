    <!-- Expedia Styleguide colors -->
    <!-- These are base colors that we intend to use throughout all LOB and portions of the app.
            The goal is that future mockups and styles just reference these values instead of
            each rewriting the hex values on their own. This is a work in progress, and any values
            prepended with "temporary" are almost definitely going to change when we finalize the
            style guide, so we want to avoid naming them fully for now, while still having this
            paradigm in place. -->
