Building
========

1. Install `JDK7` or `JDK8`.

2. Clone the `ExpediaInc/ewe-android-eb` repository

3. Navigate to the root of the `ewe-android-eb` repository.

4. Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`.

5. Run `./gradlew assembleExpediaDebug`

Once you have that working, try importing the project into **AndroidStudio** and
building from there.

Contributing
============

Please see our expectations on [Contributing](https://github.com/ExpediaInc/ewe-android-eb/wiki/Contributing)

Code Style
==========

Our Java and XML files follow a specific code style. To import the Mobiata code style first close Android Studio. You will need to edit `tools/sync-code-style.sh` to whichever version of Android Studio you are running. To do this:

1. Go to `~/Library/Preferences`

2. Note down which version of Android Studio exists there, like `AndroidStudio1.5/`

3. Then go to your `ewe-android-eb` directory

4. Open the following script `vim tools/sync-code-style.sh`

5. Edit the version (i.e. `AndroidStudio1.2`) and replace it with your version of android.

6. Run the script `./tools/sync-code-style.sh`

Restart Android Studio and select `MobiataIntellij` via `Preferences -> Code Style -> Java -> Scheme`.

Set XML style via `Preferences -> Code Style -> XML - > Set from ... -> Predefined Style -> Android`.

Unit Tests
==============

These live in `lib/ExpediaBookings/` and have no Android dependencies so we can
run them very quickly just on the `JVM`.

There are also android unit tests and robolectric tests living in the android project


````shell
./gradlew :lib:ExpediaBookings:test :lib:mocked:mocke3:test :project:testExpediaDebug
````

Android Tests
==================

Make sure the device(s) that will be running the tests has turned off animations:
Window Animation, Transition Animation, Animator Duration.

```shell
./gradlew --no-daemon forkExpediaDebug
```

Creating Feature Builds
=======================

Suppose you want to create a build so people can see what you've done. You can
actually give it a unique package name and upload the `apk` to Crashlytics.
`UNIQUE_FEATURE_NAME` must be a valid Java package name part because the
resulting `applicationId` becomes `com.expedia.bookings.feature.UNIQUE_FEATURE_NAME`.

````shell
    $ ./gradlew -Pid="feature.UNIQUE_FEATURE_NAME" assembleExpediaDebug
    $ ./gradlew -Pid="feature.UNIQUE_FEATURE_NAME" crashlyticsUploadDistributionExpediaDebug
````

Creating Usability Builds
=======================

Passing in `-Pid="usability` while assembling a release build triggers special functionality
to always suppress final bookings for all lines of business. This is behavior deemed important
for third-party usability testing through www.usertesting.com. We will likely share these builds
via Crashlytics share link.

````shell
    $ ./gradlew -Pid="usability" assembleExpediaRelease
````
