Not much time for tourning about but wonderful neighbourhoods for walks.  River and lakeshore walks are wonderful.  Achitecture Institute river cruise well worth doing.\r\nElephant and Castle located in the hotel had great beer and English Pub food.",

Then I went into the bathroom and conditions were even worse. Bathroom was old and outdated. the shower looked so unwelcoming that I couldn't even take a shower! There was toilet paper stuck in the toilet and it wouldn't get flushed!! did they even clean this room??? I couldn't sleep properly because every time the room next to me opened or closed their door I could hear it so well and it was very loud! Then the day of check out before it was even noon and I had not yet checked out the maid came to the clean the room!!",
