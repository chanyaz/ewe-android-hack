Everything was blocked off. You could get to the elevator and your hotel room and that was it. However, I can live with the construction and without the beautiful atrium courtyard for a brief stay. The topper to this stay was there was no running water in the bathtub/shower. The bathroom sink had water but not the tub. We called the front desk and there was no answer. We called the concierge, they answered, transferred us to the front desk and no answer. We tried four times to get someone to answer. We became extremely frustrated and packed up and left. When I checked out the lady at the \"front\" desk was very pleasant and took care of our dinner charge on our room. However, I will now always try the shower faucet when I first arrive at a Hotel to make sure it works before I settle in.  ",

There was extensive construction going on so I'm sure they had the space but it was a truly wonderful gesture that made a huge difference to us since we didn't leave the room until the day we flew out. All of the staff were welcoming and super accommodating with any request. I'm sure they were super focused on customer service because of the inconvenience of the construction.

At arrival, I was annoyed by the construction and on top of that I was told that Hyatt doesn't have queen beds only full size beds.  \r\nTo accommodate, I was offered complimentary parking. So I do appreciate the customer service. I don't appreciate being surprised about the construction and the small beds. ",
