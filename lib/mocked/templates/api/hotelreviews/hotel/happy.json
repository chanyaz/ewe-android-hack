The valet when we pulled up was so friendly and helpful! And then the staff at the registration desk made sure to give us a quiet room because we had an early flight. The room was clean and quiet, with a little balcony overlooking the atrium. The concierge gave us the rundown on restaurants we could walk to, and we really enjoyed our dinner at Max\u0027s,and the next morning, the shuttle was right on time, with a friendly driver, and it was all fantastic!  After our flight back, the shuttle was right there, we called the hotel, and our car was waiting for us, and the valet opened our doors for us with smiles and friendliness.  I highly reccommend!!",
